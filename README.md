# sleepdata.org-Dataset-Preprocessing
This MATLAB project processes EDF files from the MESA, CFS, SHHS, and MROS datasets. The main functionality includes extracting signal data based on specific events (e.g., sleep stages, apnea events), applying a sliding window to segment the data, and saving each segment to a CSV file with corresponding labels for further analysis.
